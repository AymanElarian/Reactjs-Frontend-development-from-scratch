# Programming Types

Common programming paradigms include:

1. Procedural progamming
   1. grouping your code into functions, and call them when needed.
   2. its an imperative style of development, very common for PHP developers, and javascript too !
2. Functional Programming
   1. does not allow sideeffects, its very common for frontend developement, specially for React.js
3. Object Oriented Programming
   1. Grouping login, state, and behaviour into Classes or Objects, its a common paradigm for OOP languages like Java
   2. its not favorable for frontend javascript, yet many developers tends to lean towards it !
4. imperative
   1. allows side effects, this is contrast of functional programming.
5. declarative





* [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
  which allows side effects,
* [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
  which disallows side effects,
* [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
  which does not state the order in which operations execute,
* [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
  which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
* [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)
  which groups code into functions,
* [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming)
  which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
* [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_programming)
  programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar.
