# Angular vs AngularJs

one of the most confusing disadvategs of angular -in my point of view- is the confusion that was introduced with the release of Angular v2.

First whats common between Angular and AngularJs, the answer is very simple nothing !, angular v2+ was a complete rewrite of famous and most succeful framework in javascript history, it was developed with ES6, modules, server side rendering in mind, and heavly prompoting for typescript rather than using native javascript.



That stated, in an attempt to make this less confusing for developers, Angular team proposed that from now on \(Angular 2 release\) Angular v1. should be refered to as **AngularJs and keep Angular to refer to Angular 2++,**

so as a frontend developer, the instance you read Angular you should assume that it mean Angular 2+, yet again this is very disappointing and confusing handling, because for instance, when searching [stackoverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com)for a problem in AngularJs you will end up with dozens of Angular Posts, which are completely irrelevant to what you are looking for, and vice versa. searching for Angular 2+ will result in same problem.

you can also spot this confusion in internet posts, people will often write_ Angular 4, or Angular or Angular 2+ or Angular 5._



i really think that Angularshould have been released under a different name, and left **AngularJs **alive. but for certain reasons, google decided to kill AngularJs project
