Web is composed of HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT

a frontend developer is not a frontend developer unless he master these three scripting languages.

for HTML and CSS we will go very very very fast on basics, but its a requirement for this course that you Master you HTML and CSS skills before continue as we will not talk about them much during future chapters as they are taken for granted,

Missing [any of Chapte1 topics](chapter_1) or HTML or CSS is considered _**Lack of Basic Knowledge**_. and i would recommend you go through few basic courses first before continuing to read this book.
