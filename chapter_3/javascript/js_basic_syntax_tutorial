Data Types:
String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations
Objects:  var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; 

var weight = '50,000'
console.log('Weight is ' + weight + 'pounds) // Interpolation is used to concatenate strings.
Putting a variable in a string uses concepts we've already learned. The JavaScript term for this idea is Interpolation.

Printing on the console: 
console.log("Name: " + myString);
console.log("Lucky Number: " + myNumber);
console.log("Good joke? " + myBoolean);

Built-in Math functions :

Math.random();
Math.floor();
if-else:
var needCoffee = true;
if (needCoffee) {
         console.log('Finding coffee');
 } else {
         console.log('Keep on keeping on!');
  }

check if two things equal each other, we can use === (three equals in a row).
To check if two things do not equal each other, we can write !== (exclamation with two equals in a row).

FUNCTIONS :

var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
if (calculatorOn) {
     console.log('Calculator turning off.');
     calculatorOn = false;
} else {
     console.log('Calculator turning on.');
     calculatorOn = true;
     }
}

Arrays :
var bucketList = ['Rappel into a cave', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
bucketList.length --> prints length of array

Built-in Math functions :
push() --> adds to the end of the array
bucketList.push('item 3', 'item 4');
pop()

for Loop:
for(var i=0;i<vacationSpots.length;i++) {
}


We can link a JavaScript file to HTML by including it as the src of a <script> tag inside of an HTML file, like this:


<script src='js/main.js'></script>


alert('Hello JavaScript!');

Note: alert is a JavaScript function that will create a pop-up window with text inside it. When we link the main.js file to the HTML file, we will see a pop-up window that was generated by this code. alert is not used by JavaScript developers in practice, however it is useful here to demonstrate linking these two files. We will use it over the next few exercises for demonstration purposes.

We can select an HTML element with JavaScript by selecting its class attribute, like this:


var header = document.getElementsByClassName('example-class-name');



isNaN(x) // a function to check if the parameter is a not a number
var a="apple"
isNaN(a)  // returns true

Strings:

myString.indexOf("string")  // outputs the Index of the S in string and '-1' if not found

myString.toLowerCase();

myString.slice(startIndexIncluded, endIndexExcluded);

myString.slice(startIndexIncluded) // in which case it slices the string till the end  

myString.split(",");

Objects:
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.driver="mazen";
myCar.drive=function(){console.log("drive");};
myCar.drive();

ANOTHER COOL WAY :

var myCar = {
driver: "MAZEN",
maxSpeed: 100,
drive:  function()
     {
         console.log("drive");
     };
} //No need to write myCar.whatever

constructor:
var Car = function(maxSpeed, driver){
     this.maxSpeed= maxSpeed;
     this.driver=driver;
     this.drive=function(){console.log("drive");};
}
myCar1= new Car(70,"Ninja Man");
