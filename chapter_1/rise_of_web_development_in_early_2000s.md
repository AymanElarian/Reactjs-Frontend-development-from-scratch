# Rise of web development in early 2000’s {#rise-of-web-development-in-early-2000-s}

## PHP \[Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter\] & or PHP/FI

**PHP** stated in 1995 yet it appeared to public in 2003 after rebranding into PHP 3 which was meant for dynamic content scripting tool, other than html static files

In 2005 php5 was released, with more support for OOP concepts, yet Rasmus Leadoff –creator of PHP- continued to defend scripting nature of PHP and leaned toward procedural functional programming, over OOP.

* Everyone wanted a website, business started to grow, they started to spot business ROI
* WordPress appeared on 2003 as a successor of b2/cafelog, CMS took web development by storm
* Online shops started business
* With more developers, IDE started to come up.
* Mozilla Firefox came from ashes of Netscape, Google released Chrome, and safari and IE followed
* Concept of User interface and web design came to life.

Web design matured and advanced, and a task of converting images to Markup \(html and css\) started to be a job.

### Rise of Mobile devices {#rise-of-mobile-devices}

Web developers started to recognize need to understand browser rendering, and responsive design

* Web developers started building 2 versions of same website www.site.com” and “m.site.com” for mobiles
* Chrome and browser vendor starting evolving CSS and HTML rendering engineers, media query allowed to use only 1 version
* JavaScript Frameworks And frontend became a thing..
* Up till this point the term frontend development was not existent, website where build using server side languages
* JavaScript framework \(angular\) was introduced in 2005, and it took web by storm
* HTML5 API came along, with geo location, localStorage, sessions

**Reactjs was announced in 2015**, relatively young, yet it addresses and introduced concepts of Virtual Dom, server side rendering, and it defanitly took web frontend developement to a whole new level with its unique EcoSystem

Angular 2 was created, a complete rewrite of angular, allow angular to compete with Reactjs

### React.js Eco System

React on its own is a U.I. library, it doesnot handle anything other than rendering JSX React components "which are not even a true web components" into browser.

#### React Learning curve is easy.. or is it ?

If you are going to learn react to use it on its own, **its Propably not worth it !**  
React is not the react.js Library, its the Collection of other libraries that you can use **with** react to create a web applications.

for this reason you will hear people saying that learning react is easy, yet this is not true !.

if you mean learning React.js its self alone, then yes its easy, but you cannot create anything useful with react.js alone ! to create a webapp using react you will probably need few more libraries like

* React Router :- which handle browser/mobile app routing for your app
* Redux :- Any modern react.js app should be based on State magament concept of Redux/flux architutcture
* Immutable.js :- Provide Blazing fast Data Structrures and immutability functions that are missing from native javascript

  * ordered Lists
  * Ordered Maps
  * Deques's
  * Records

  and many more. so a thing to understand is **React is an Eco-system** once you learn it and love it. you will never go back !
